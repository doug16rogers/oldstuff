*  TITLE:        New Write EEPROM Packet
*
*  DESCRIPTION:  The subprogram "New_Write_EEPROM_Packet"
*                allocates an EEPROM Write packet for the
*                SDLC link.  The header is filled in.
*                The destination will be determined
*                by the address to be written.

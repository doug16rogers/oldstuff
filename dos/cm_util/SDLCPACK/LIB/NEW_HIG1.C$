*  TITLE:        New High Speed Read Packet
*
*  DESCRIPTION:  The subprogram "New_High_Speed_Read_Packet"
*                allocates a High Speed EEPROM Read packet for the
*                SDLC link.  The header is filled in.
*                The destination will be determined
*                by the address to be read.

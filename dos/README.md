## DOS

These archives ran on DOS. Most were written in the late eighties and early
nineties. Probably my favorite was L.COM, Conway's Game of Life for the DOS
text video memory.

The zip files and accompanying text files are in archvies/. The files that I
was able to extract are present in the repo. Eventually I'll try to recover
cs.zip, frac.zip and go.zip.

Here's an overview of the contents:

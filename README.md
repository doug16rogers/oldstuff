## Old Stuff

Here are some of my archives. I recently scrambled to find some of these so I
decided that github was a good place to put them.

### DOS

These archives ran on DOS. Most were written in the late eighties and early
nineties. Probably my favorite was L.COM, Conway's Game of Life for the DOS
text video memory.

Each archive listed below has an accompanying text file that lists the output of PK-Zip.
